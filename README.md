# Phase 2

## 2.1 Cache

In `DataManager`, a hash map is used for caching. 

```Java
private Map<String, String> contributorCache = new HashMap<>();
```

Each time when calling `getContributorName` method, the program will first check whether the Cache contains the id. If it contains, then the data in cache will be returned. Otherwise, the programm will query the server for the name. 

## 2.2 (Ruxi Xu)

Added `DataManagerRobustnessTests.java` in Organization App. All thest are passed.
UI is updated to display meaningful error message.

## 2.3 Organization App aggregate donations by contributor (Tim Song)

I create a new class `AggregateDonation` which contains the aggregated donation information for each fund.
It is created during the creation of that fund in the memory.

## 2.7 Organization App delete fund
I append a while loop in the end of display fund function to ask the user whether to delete this fund. 
I add a new function in the DataManager class, and also delete the fund info in the memory object.
I add unit test and mock objects to test the new function.

## 2.8 (Ruxi Xu)

Added logout function in UI classes; login again feature is also added to let user log back in after logout.

## 2.10 Encryptation (Boshu Lei)

Prepare the `public_key.pem` under `\org` and `\admin` folder. Prepare the `private_key.pem` under `\admin` folder. 

When launching javascript, please use the following command.

```
 node --security-revert=CVE-2023-46809 .\api.js
 node .\admin.js
```
